            <h3 id="aboutme">About Me</h3>
                <p>My name is Lucky, and when my owners walked into the Dumb Friends League in Colorado, I barked at them until they adopted me. It's funny because unless I really want to play, I am mostly a quiet pup, but I knew I had to get their attention or I would lose my chance.<br><br> Now that I fooled them into adopting me, I behave all the time, except when I am left alone. Then ansything and everything that is left in my sight is fair game to be chewed. I know this frustrates my owners, but I can't help it when there't nothing else to do. Maybe they should take me to the dog park more. </p>
            <h3 id="myadventures">My Adventures</h3>
                    <p>My most recent adventure was just the dog park, but we hadn't been since I injured my Dad and he couldn't walk too well. So it was worth the wait, and I was happy to be back.</p>
