		<p>On <strong>September 7th, 2019</strong>, the Angles family and the Kostelac family joined together as one with the vow that follows:</p><br>
		<p class="vow">I love you. You are my best friend.<br>
		Today I give myself to you in marriage.<br>
		I promise to encourage and inspire you, to laugh with you,<br>
		and to comfort you in times of sorrow and struggle.<br>
		I promise to love you in good times and in bad,<br>
		when life seems easy and when it seems hard,<br>
		when our love is simple, and when it is an effort.<br>
		I promise to cherish you, and to always hold you in highest regard.<br>
		These things I give to you today, and all the days of our life.<br><br><br><br>
		<p>We want to thank everyone that came with us both to the ceremony and to the reception to celebrate the unification of this family in marriage. <br> Please enjoy photos from the ceremony and reception and a page about our new puppy.</p>
